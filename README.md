# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images
* Future improving

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Figma**

**Images**

We exporting images directly from Figma. [Here](https://tinypng.com/) you can optimize your images, so your project loads faster. 

**Future improving**
I consider to add more font-sizes or font-sizes for titles, subtitles and texts because the screen size can be changed and the text must be optimized to each size.

Have fun when you observe it!
