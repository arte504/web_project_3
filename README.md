### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images
* Future improving
* GitHub pages

**Intro**

* This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Figma**

* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AtbNbstbxWPcMqvF061V0R/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

* We exporting images directly from Figma. [Here](https://tinypng.com/) you can optimize your images, so your project loads faster. 

**Future improving**
* I consider to add more font-sizes or font-sizes for titles, subtitles and texts because the screen size can be changed and the text must be optimized to each size.

**GitHub pages**
* You can look at the project as a deployed website at the GitHub pages [here](https://arte504.github.io/web_project_3/).

*Have fun when you observe it!*
